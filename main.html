                    <!-- write a bit about me here -->
                    <div>
                        <p>My name is Tasos, I was born in Greece and grew up in Cyprus. I have a background in business, marketing, entrepreneurship, data science and now software development. </br>
                            <p style="font-style: italic;">How did I develop my diverse skillset?</p>
                        I have a bachelors in business, I co-founded a SAAS startup, failed, went back to uni and got a masters in Data Science for Business, worked as a data scientist and a business analyst for 2 years, and now I am teaching myself software development.
                        </p> 

                        <p style="font-style: italic;">Why am I learning software development?</p>

                        <p>Well, I decided that I want to become a full-stack Data Scientist. The field of data science for business is quite new and a lot of people still try to define it but through my experience I came up with my own full-stack Data Scientist definition in my head. Let me try and define it shortly:
                            <p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">A data scientist is someone with business knowledge who can collect, clean, and organise big data with the end goal of mining them and provide business value from the data.</br>
                            A machine learning engineer (MLE) is someone with the technical knowledge required to develop a software product/app which uses machine learning algorithms insight. Often, MLEs will work with DSs who are responsible to provide the problem definitions the MLE tries to solve.  
                            </p>
                        Having the skills to both define the problems we can or cannot solve with data and being able to develop an end-to-end software product/app which utilises machine learning algorithms to solve the problems I define will allow me to develop data solutions that provide solutions at scale for one or multiple organisations.
                        </p>
